# Modifications of Variable Neighborhood Search Heuristic Applied in Partitional Clustering 

This project investigates the efficiency of Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) heuristic and its modifications in partitional clustering. The clustering problem is defined in terms of minimization of the sum of squared distances between a clustering dataset points and their clusterâ€™s centroid. The main stages in resolving the described clustering problem are constructing neighborhoods of a feasible solution and
improving it with a specific modification of VNS. Two new ideas of constructing neighborhood  are introduced and applied on some publicly available and well known datasets.
